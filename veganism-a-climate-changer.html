                        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                        <p>We have all been there: scrolling through Instagram, and suddenly, a wave of posts,
                            advocating for Veganism (a plant-based diet that restricts the consumption of animal
                            products) begins to surround your feed. They claim that going Vegan is the way to save the
                            planet and that it’ll help solve Obesity. Then, you begin to wonder, how effective is
                            Veganism in solving the climate crisis? Read on to find out the answer to your burning
                            questions about this topic.</b></p>
                        <p>This article aims to evaluate the extent to which Veganism is effective in helping us solve
                            the climate crisis. By weighing its environmental and socio-economic benefits, its
                            effectiveness will be compared to other climate change solutions. Hence, this helps us
                            understand the extent to which veganism may be our “best bet” when nurturing sustainable
                            communities. </p>

                        <p><b>Veganism and the environment: Huh? </b></p>
                        <p>Before understanding the effectiveness of veganism, let’s understand how Veganism and the
                            environment are even connected.</p>
                        <p>Veganism helps reduce the huge cost of industrialized animal farming, which contributes to
                            14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions induced by humans (Solomon, 2007), and this statistic
                            continues to increase every day.</p>
                        <p>For us to consume meat and animal products such as dairy, livestock has to be farmed. This
                            process of livestock farming requires an excessive amount of water, land, and grass, among
                            other items. All such things, coupled together, contribute to land and water degradation,
                            and deforestation; thus, exacerbating imbalances in the ecosystem and negatively impacting
                            the environment. Hence, going vegan and consuming plants instead relieves this burden that
                            is imposed by livestock farming; hence, helping us consume less energy, which makes it a
                            sustainable practice.</p>
                        <p>But all of this sounds too good to be true, right? That is because it is. While the
                            environmental cost is reduced due to veganism and human behaviors regarding eco-friendless
                            are improved, other socio-cultural, health, and economic implications make it less effective
                            in achieving environmental change on a systemic level.</p>
                        <p><b>Evaluation of Veganism: effective or not? </b></p>
                        <p>It is important to note that much more than having positive impacts on the environment,
                            Veganism works by mitigating much of the negative impact which meat-eaters have on the
                            environment. By reducing the negative impacts of livestock farming, such as greenhouse gas
                            emissions, Veganism is an effective strategy as it “undoes.” However, it has been proven
                            that Veganism can do more than undoing, and may be an active contributor to sustainability.
                            The pros of Veganism, investigated by Rosi, include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Veganism reduces GHGs and energy consumption, removes nitrous oxides which drive
                                climate change and helps conserve water. Not only this, but it reduces aquatic pollution
                                which is exacerbated by the seafood industry. Hence, making it an all-rounded solution
                                when responding to climate change.</li>
                            <li> 2. It protects rainforests and lands by preventing deforestation which commonly occurs
                                due to livestock farming. It also protects the soil and helps it recover from
                                degradation which occurs due to livestock farming.</li>
                            <li> 3. It preserves habitats and prevents the extinction of species; as we know, animals
                                play a vital role in the ecosystem. Thus, improving animal health and longevity allows
                                us to prevent ecological imbalances.</li>
                            <li> 4. Veganism helps improve the health statuses of communities by providing vitamins,
                                minerals, and essential nutrients which are absent in animal products. Improved health
                                results in decreased risk of illnesses and hence, reduced dependence on antibiotics-
                                which are known to pollute the environment.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Despite the positive impacts, veganism has various “cons” which may make it a less effective
                            climate changer:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Vitamins like Vitamin D and B12 are often absent in plant-based foods, which can make
                                vegans more prone to health issues; thus, accelerating public health crises.</li>

                            <li>2. Vegan food items such as fruits and vegetables are often economically unviable for
                                the vast majority, particularly because more quick and inexpensive food alternatives
                                such as fast food are often substituted for healthy ones. </li>

                            <li>3. Oftentimes, the Vegan food industry markets expensive vegan food items such as fake
                                meats, plant-based milk, and other exotic fruits and vegetables, which makes individuals
                                assume that Veganism is unsustainable. However, this is more of a systemic issue in the
                                marketing industry, than an issue of Veganism itself. Still, it limits individuals from
                                achieving health and well-being.
                            </li>

                            <li> 4. Veganism is a political challenge; governments of many countries are not invested in
                                achieving environmental benefits and do not realize their common but differentiated
                                responsibility over the environment; this lack of liberal perspective hints at their
                                capitalistic nature which prioritizes economic gain from meat industries. Hence, this
                                complex political challenge makes it difficult to make Veganism accessible to the
                                general public. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                        <blockquote class="alime-blockquote">
                            <h4>Overall, Veganism has various benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, it helps preserve
                                energy and adopt sustainable behaviors; however, on the other hand, it may be an
                                economically unviable and difficult behavior to sustain for most individuals. Still,
                                veganism’s positive impacts outweigh its negatives, making it an important tool in
